# depaul-brand-consistency

There are two separate areas of focus. First, the preview page that displays the actual modules. Second, each individual modules that will get used.

As expected, running into issues with redefining simple bootstrap classnames with dpu specific classnames like 'container'. Will use dpu- prefix for those conflicts and bc- prefix for brand consistency specific classnames.
